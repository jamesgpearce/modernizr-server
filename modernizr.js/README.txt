The copy of Modernizr that comes with this includes every possible test offered in the Modernizr Builder and is uncompressed.

You can create any version of Modernizr you want:
http://modernizr.com/download/

It can be compressed or uncompressed (although of the course the former is better for production).

Regardless, the file in this folder MUST be named modernizr.js.

Just replace the included version with yours, in this directory.
